#
Created `VBA script` that `loops` through all the stocks for **one year** and outputs the following information,
the `ticker symbol`,

**yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,**
the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year,
the total stock volume of the stock,

#
added `functionality` to the `script` to return the stock with the `"Greatest % increase"`, `"Greatest % decrease"`, and `"Greatest total volume"`.

#
Made the appropriate adjustments to `VBA script` to enable it to `run` on every worksheet (that is, every `year`) at once (for year `2020`, year `2019` and year `2018`),
used `conditional formatting` that will highlight `positive change` in `green` and `negative change` in `red` by `VBA script`.

## Final Statement for Provided Data
Based on the given data analysis for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the following conclusions can be drawn:

## Greatest Percentage Increases:  
Throughout the course of the three years, the` ticker symbol` "YDT" continuously showed the largest % gain in value, demonstrating exceptional performance in comparison to other stocks in each year. This implies that "YDT" may have benefited from significant expansion prospects or favorable market perception.

## Greatest Percentage Decreases: 
The `ticker symbols` **"VNTO"** in `2020`, **"RKY"** in `2019`, and **"RKY"** once more in `2018` on the other hand, displayed the biggest percentage declines in value. Significant losses were seen in these equities, which may have been brought on by subpar financial results, market turbulence, or other unfavorable elements influencing investor mood.

## Greatest Total Volume: 
Over the course of the three years, the `ticker symbol` **"QKN"** continuously had the highest total stock volume traded. This suggests that there is a lot of trading activity and liquidity for **"QKN"** which makes it a desirable choice for investors seeking actively traded assets.

## Consistency in `Top Performers`:
Even if the performance of some stocks may have varied from year to year, some patterns became apparent. For example, "YDT" had robust growth every year, whereas "RKY" saw notable decreases in two of the three years.

## Market Dynamics:
The data illustrates how the `stock market` is dynamic and how `equities` move in both `good` and `negative` directions over time. These swings are influenced by a number of `variables`, including `investor mood`, `industry trends`, `corporate performance`, and **`macroeconomic` situations**.

## Diversification and `Risk Management`:
Using these insights, **investors** may adjust their investing strategy to emphasize diversity as a means of reducing the risks associated with the `performance` of particular `stocks`. Investors can more effectively manage market volatility and seize `growth` opportunities by **diversifying** their holdings across a range of assets and industries.

### Ultimately, the data analysis emphasizes how critical it is to keep an eye on stock performance, spot trends, and make well-informed investing decisions based on past performance as well as current market conditions.
